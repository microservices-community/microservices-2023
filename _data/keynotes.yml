   title: Assessing the scalability of microservice architectures
   affiliation: FHV - Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences, Dornbirn (Austria)
   abstract: |
     Microservices have emerged as an architectural style for developing maintainable and scalable applications. Assessing the performance of architecture deployment configurations — e.g., with respect to deployment alternatives — is challenging and must be aligned with the system usage in the production environment. In this talk I present an approach for using operational profiles to generate load tests to automatically assess scalability pass/fail criteria of microservice configuration alternatives. The approach provides a domain-based metric for each alternative that can, for instance, be applied to make informed decisions about the selection of alternatives and to conduct production monitoring regarding performance-related system properties, e.g., anomaly detection. We have evaluated our approach using extensive experiments in a large bare metal host environment and a virtualized environment. The talk with briefly introduce the concept of microservices, present the deployment approach and the evaluation approach based on the open source tool locust.io; it will present the tool PPTAM used to conduct the experiments and the performed data analysis.

#   title: Crossing the Chasm Between AI Services and AI-powered Workflows
#   abstract: |
#     Companies are devoting significant effort -and budget- into powering
#     their processes with AI. Despite the strong push by both AI customers
#     (the enterprise) and providers of AI services and technology,
#     the journey to AI is often not simple -or not as simple as expected at
#     first- and the benefits are hard to assess. This is surprising to many,
#     given the amazing success that AI seems to have on all sorts of domains,
#     where super-human performance is reported in many tasks seemingly related
#     to what AI is asked to do in the enterprise.
#     In this talk I will present some of the reasons for the disconnect between
#     the (perceived) quality of AI services on one side, and the transformational
#     impact they can have on AI-powered enterprise processes on the other.
#     I will focus specifically on two key problems that limit adoption of AI
#     services today. The first is that the way we measure and communicate the quality
#     of AI services is fundamentally wrong, and this leads to wrong process design
#     decisions and to an improper use of AI in business processes.
#     The second is that AI service and technology providers often focus on the benefits
#     of AI services once in production, but underestimate the importance of simplifying
#     the journey that process owners have to follow to get there.
#     I will present concrete examples of both issues, and show (i) how we can rethink
#     the notion of AI quality in enterprise processes and (ii) how AI can simplify
#     its own journey to adoption, thereby helping AI services to cross the adoption chasm.

#   title: The Microservice Hypothesis
#   abstract: |
#     Microservice architectures are based on the hypothesis that by keeping
#     components small, this can foster their autonomy and independent evolution.
#     Microservices reframed the modularity issue as a decomposition problem,
#     where APIs are introduced to reconnect separately deployed components.
#     In this talk we will explore a large collection of real-world APIs looking
#     for patterns attempting to illustrate the relationship between size and
#     coupling, both in space and time.
